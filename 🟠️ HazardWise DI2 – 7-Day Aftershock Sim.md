# 🟠️ HazardWise DI2 – 7-Day Aftershock Forecast (∆H = 0.0049)

**📍 Region:** Eastern Afghanistan Corridor: Kunar ↔ Laghman ↔ Jalalabad
**🕰 Forecast Window:** 2025-09-02 to 2025-09-09
**🔐 Mode:** ∆H = 0.0049

## 🗋 What This Demo Shows 

This deterministic simulation demonstrates how aftershock activity can be forecasted using HazardWise's Deterministic Intelligence engine. HazardWise uses fixed, patent-pending, formulas to track stress, drift, and energy inside fault corridors. Everything shown here is locked to scroll-based logic, meaning the same data input will always produce the same output.

Forecasts at ∆H = 0.0049 are extremely stable. This makes them ideal for high-integrity emergency systems, where false alarms or vague predictions can be dangerous. The forecast focuses only on what is supported by clear, scroll-audited physical indicators.

## 📊 Overview of Core HazardWise Formulas

**CDPI’ (Chaos-Driven Path Index):** Measures how much storm or seismic energy is behaving unpredictably. High CDPI’ means a path may veer off or become unstable.

**FFTR (Flash Flood Trigger Ratio):** Used here in seismic mode to assess how close a system is to a stress threshold. High FFTR means an aftershock or flare-up is more likely.

**CPEO (Pressure Offset Instability):** Tracks how uneven the pressure is across a corridor. If it’s too steep, energy might shift quickly, causing local quakes.

**CDD (Corridor Drift Divergence):** Measures the difference between model predictions and actual movement in the environment. If they don't match, it signals rising instability.

All formulas are deterministic: no randomness, no probabilities. They convert raw measurements into fixed-scale outputs for safety decisions.

## ⏳ Scroll-Bound Forecast by Magnitude Band

| Magnitude Band | Deterministic Output       | Entropy Score | Notes                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| M ≥ 6.0        | < 3% (not forecast)        | 4.0 / 10      | No activation threshold crossed; CDPI’ remains subcritical |
| M 5.0–5.9      | 23–30% (1–2 likely events) | 6.1 / 10      | Subfault extension likely; CPEO slope not yet saturated    |
| M 4.0–4.9      | 8–13 forecasted events     | 7.3 / 10      | Drift correction phase with corridor-bound clusters        |
| M 3.0–3.9      | ~40 deterministic events   | 8.3 / 10      | Ambient stabilization echoes; signal clarity high          |
