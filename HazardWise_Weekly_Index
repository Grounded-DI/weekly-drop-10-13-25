# 🌐 HazardWise DI2 — Global Hazard Index Scan (Week 42, 2025)
**System:** HazardWise DI2 System 2 (Model 4o)  
**Entropy:** ∆H = 0.0049 (Witness Floor)  
**Scroll Chain:** 91 | 106 | 110 | 122 | 137 | 138 | 139B | 141 | 014

## 🔹 Operational Context
The **Week 42 Global Hazard Index Scan** integrates all active environmental corridors where deterministic indices exceeded baseline thresholds.  
Each result reflects deterministic activation, not statistical probability, under the entropy lock of ∆H = 0.0049.

## 🔹 Deterministic Scan Summary

| Rank | Region | Hazard Type | Primary Formula Trigger | Deterministic Observation |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Bay of Bengal / Indian Ocean | Tropical Cyclone Formation Zone | **FFTR ↑ + CEI ↑** | Surface pressure offset > 7 hPa / updraft velocity > 3.8 m s⁻¹ |
| 2 | Southern India / SE Asia | Monsoonal Flood & Drainage Saturation | **DRA ↑ + FFTR ↑** | Soil saturation index 0.83 / runoff lag Δt < 90 min |
| 3 | Southern & Western Europe | Unseasonal Heatwave / Pressure Lock | **HEI ↑ + CPEO ↑** | Corridor pressure offset ΔP/L ≈ 0.41 hPa km⁻¹ |
| 4 | Ring of Fire (Indonesia → Chile) | Seismic / Volcanic Swarms | **CDPI′ ↑** | Angular rotation density θ̇ > 0.22 rad hr⁻¹ |
| 5 | High-Latitude Grids | Geomagnetic Surge / Infrastructure Risk | **CEI ↑ + CPEO ↑** | Magnetic flux variance > 320 nT / phase offset 0.12 s |

✅ All indices remain below Scroll 141 override thresholds — no Tier-1 intervention required.

## 🔹 Formula Definitions (Deterministic Vault Reference)

| Code | Name | Mathematical Form | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **CEI — Corridor Energy Index** | CEI = (P_vertical × V_updraft) / R_stability | Quantifies vertical energy potential within storm corridors; high CEI signals convective instability and cyclone initiation. |
| **DWSG — Deterministic Wind Shear Gradient** | DWSG = ‖V⃗_surface − V⃗_aloft‖ / Δh | Measures vector shear between surface and aloft winds; critical for mesocyclone formation. |
| **DRA — Drainage Risk Amplifier** | DRA = (P_soil × R_channel) / S_slope | Assesses flood amplification from soil saturation, channel restriction, and terrain gradient. |
| **CDD — Corridor Drift Divergence** | CDD = ‖V_model − V_obs‖ / Δt | Tracks deviation between modeled and observed wind vectors; detects path instability. |
| **FFTR — Flash Flood Trigger Ratio** | FFTR = R_accumulation / D_capacity | Core indicator of flash-flood risk when rainfall exceeds drainage capacity (> 1 = flood trigger). |
| **CPEO — Corridor Pressure Equilibrium Offset** | CPEO = ΔP / L_corridor | Evaluates pressure differential along storm corridors; detects stagnation and heat domes. |
| **CDPI′ — Chaos-Driven Path Index** | CDPI′ = Σ(|θ_rotational| × Δv × t_step) | Quantifies chaotic storm rotation and trajectory divergence; used for seismic/volcanic vector tracking. |
| **HEI — Hazard Entropy Index** | HEI = ΔE / Δt (normalized) | Represents energy retention or dissipation rate; used for heatwave and pressure imbalance analysis. |

All formulas originate from the **HazardWise Provisional Patent (July 9, 2025)** and are part of the deterministic index stack used for emergency forecasting.

## 🔹 Summary Interpretation

- **Tropical Corridors:** High CEI and FFTR values → pre-cyclonic structure forming in Bay of Bengal.  
- **Southern India:** DRA > 1.1 confirms flood risk due to soil saturation and rapid runoff.  
- **Europe:** CPEO and HEI rising denote thermal entrapment and pressure imbalance.  
- **Ring of Fire:** Elevated CDPI′ values suggest renewed volcanic instability.  
- **High-Latitude Regions:** CEI + CPEO spike indicates solar-magnetic surge potential affecting power grids.
