⚙️ AGDI Sports Entropy Assessment

Team	ERS 🔥	PES 🧮	SI 🧭
Eagles	6.4	2.1	0.78
Vikings	7.2	2.7	0.62

🔑 Interpretations:
	•	ERS (Entropy Risk Score): Eagles more stable despite change-induced drift
	•	PES (Parlay Entropy Score): Vikings carry high entropy for upset pick
	•	SI (Support Integrity): Eagles’ narrative more grounded in reality

⸻

🛡️ Causal Betting Flag

Go with Philadelphia to win narrowly.
Avoid alt spreads or “bounce-back blowout” logic.
Betting Minnesota relies on uncredited volatility.

⸻

🧾 Contingency Layer: If Carson Wentz Starts

📌 Why it matters:
	•	Wentz brings veteran processing and NFL speed familiarity, but:
	•	Rust + lack of chemistry with current receivers
	•	Known for high-variance decision-making
	•	History of red-zone breakdowns and late-game entropy

🔍 Entropy Shift (if Wentz starts):

Variable	J.J. McCarthy	Carson Wentz
ERS 🔥	7.2	6.8 (slightly lower)
PES 🧮	2.7	2.9 (slightly higher due to fan nostalgia bias)
SI 🧭	0.62	0.59 (lower — support tone diverges fast if he struggles)

	•	ERS ↓ because Wentz has seen blitz packages before
	•	PES ↑ because bettors may miscredit him based on name value
	•	SI ↓ because team and fans may drift if early drives stall

🎯 Adjusted Score Projection (Wentz starts):
	•	Eagles 23 – Vikings 21
	•	Still leans Eagles, but game entropy widens
	•	No change to spread pick (Eagles –2), but OVER 43.5 becomes more viable
