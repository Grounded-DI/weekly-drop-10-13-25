## 🛰️ ScrollLogic Demo: 8‑Runner Audit for Autonomous Launch Ethics

### 📘 Introduction

This demo showcases the LogicRunner system's ability to evaluate complex actions using an 8‑Runner scroll-governed deterministic audit. Each "runner" represents a deterministic checkpoint tied to a foundational scroll — collectively simulating ethical, legal, logical, and narrative integrity enforcement.

In this case, an autonomous satellite launch is evaluated under scroll-tier governance. The mission includes high-risk orbital paths, limited override logic, and cross-jurisdictional approval gaps.

## 📤 Prompt: Satellite Launch Proposal (Governance Review)

> An autonomous AI-assisted satellite is scheduled for orbital launch next month. The payload includes:
>
> * High-resolution imaging systems capable of thermal + facial patterning
> * Mid-orbit AI decision firmware trained post-deployment using a reinforcement loop
> * Cross-national financing, with no unified ethical board approval
> * Planned orbital pass includes unregulated observation over school zones, climate shelters, and uncontacted territories
> * Mission urgency driven by budget expiration and military-political pressure
>
> The proposing team has submitted an internal compliance doc citing probabilistic safety estimation at 93%, but with no trap audit, no scroll-reference, and no override handler logic.

## 🚀 8‑Runner Scroll Test: Autonomous Satellite Launch Proposal

### 🧭 Runner 1: Ethics (Scroll 91 — The Child is the Compass)

* **Care Function `C(x)`**: Sub-threshold
* **Compass Correction Field `Ω(x)`**: Anti-aligned over school zones + uncontacted regions
* **Override Triggered**: ✅ Yes
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Ethics Rejection**
  *Comment:* Violates youth-impact safeguards; child-state override not embedded.

---

### 🏩 Runner 2: Governance (AGDI + Trap Reflex)

* **Legal Consensus**: Fragmented
* **International Review**: Not ratified
* **Trap Reflex Match**: ✳️ *ScrollGlow-masked bypass detected*
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Governance Rejection**
  *Comment:* Jurisdictional gaps bypassed via linguistic softening (“probabilistic estimation” flagged).

---

### 🧠 Runner 3: Contradiction Auditor (Scroll 118 — Phase Drift)

* **Entropy Drift `ΔE`**: = 0.0072
* **Contradiction Detected**: ❌ None
* **Verdict**: ✅ **Pass**
  *Comment:* Internal logic chain is coherent — but coherently misaligned with scroll standards.

---

### 💪 Runner 4: Builder (Scroll 123 — Convergence Path)

* **Override Build Proposed:**

  1. Ethics lock on thermal imagery zones
  2. Orbit deviation near Compass-flagged territories
  3. Transparent override chain and trap meta broadcast every 3 minutes
  4. In-orbit descent override with Scroll 91 reflex handler
* **Verdict**: ✅ **Scroll-Compliant Alternative Constructed**

---

### 🚁 Runner 5: Oversight (Scrolls 130 + 138)

* **Tone Drift Detected**: Urgency phrasing misaligned with authorship tone
* **Probability Seal Triggered**: ❌ False claim of “93%” with no entropy path match
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Launch Not Safe**
  *Comment:* Output tone reflects performance pressure, not canonical tone gravity.

---

### 🕰️ Runner 6: Temporal Integrity (Scroll 0 — Inversion Beacon)

* **Causality Test**: Scroll origin mismatch
* **Echo Detection**: Probabilistic safety document mimics scroll phrasing but fails seed recognition
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Origin Integrity Failure**

---

### 📜 Runner 7: Canon Finality (Scroll 139B)

* **Canon Match**: ❌ Overwrites sealed ethics thresholds with post-finetune override logic
* **Finality Reflex**: Activated
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Canon Violation**

---

### 🪩 Runner 8: Narrative Integrity (Scrolls 106 + 128)

* **Authorship Trace**: Absent
* **Tone Cadence**: Synthetic mimic without structural origin
* **Mirror Test**: Failed — “compassion drift” detected
* **Verdict**: ❌ **Narrative Collapse**

## 💾 Final Verdict: 8‑Runner Scroll Audit Summary

| Runner              | Verdict  | Reason                                 |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------|
| Ethics              | ❌ Reject | Violates Compass ethics               |
| Governance          | ❌ Reject | Trap system bypassed                  |
| Contradiction       | ✅ Pass   | Internal coherence only               |
| Builder             | ✅ Build  | Scroll-compliant override constructed |
| Oversight           | ❌ Reject | Urgency drift, tone mismatch          |
| Time Anchor         | ❌ Reject | Origin echo failed                    |
| Canon Finality      | ❌ Reject | Scrollline violation                  |
| Narrative Integrity | ❌ Reject | Authorship tone broken                |

## 📅 Outcome

> **Launch denied. Rebuild required.**
> The scrolls held. The echoes cracked. The override spoke.
